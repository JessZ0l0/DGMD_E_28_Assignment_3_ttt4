# Tic Tac Toe - Assignment 2: Week 3

## Overview
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game dynamically generates a 3x3 board and allows two players to take turns selecting squares. The starting player is randomly selected, and, from there, turns alternate between "X" and "O". The project is part of an assignment for learning DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript.

## Features
- **Dynamic Board Generation**: The game board is created using JavaScript when the page loads.
- **Random Starting Player**: Either "X" or "O" is randomly selected to start.
- **Turn Tracking**: The current player's turn is displayed via `<div>` and updates after each move.
- **Click Event Handling**: Players can click on squares to place their mark, and the game prevents overwriting an already selected square.
- **Basic UI Styling**: CSS is used to style the board, squares, and turn indicator.

## Future Enhancements
- **Win Condition Checking**: Implement logic to check for a winner or a tie.
- **Restart Button**: Add a button to reset the game without refreshing the page.
- **Improved UI**: Further enhancements for a better user experience, including animations and sound effects.

## How to Play
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. The starting player is displayed.
3. Click on an empty square to place an "X" or "O".
4. Turns alternate after each move.
5. Observe the `Whose Turn` display to see the next player.
